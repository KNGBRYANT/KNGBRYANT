# 💫 About Me:
I am data analyst with a strong foundation in statistics (BSc – 2nd class upper, MSc) and a passion about transforming data into actionable insights. My journey began with theoretical applications, but now I’m focused on solving real-world problems through data analysis and data science.💡<br><br>Currently, I work as a data analyst at Curacel, where I apply statistical methods and analytics tools to drive insights and support decision-making. My experience includes working with SQL, Tableau and Excel, alongside ongoing efforts to strengthen my Python skills for advanced analytics and automation.✨<br><br>As I continue to grow, I’m exploring machine learning and currently working on developing my first model. I have the goal of becoming a full-fledged data scientist before December, 2025.<br><br>Long-term, I aspire to blend research, teaching, and impact as a professor in statistics and data science, while contributing to meaningful advancements in the field.🚀<br><br>Numbers have always come naturally to me—maybe it runs in the family, as my dad is a professor of mathematics. Beyond data, I also care about gender equality and hope to advocate for it in the future.✨<br><br>I’m open to opportunities, collaborations, and meaningful conversations in data analysis, data science, and machine learning. 🚀<br><br>Let’s connect!✨<br>Things to know about me:<br><br>🔭 I’m currently working on my first Predictive Model<br>🌱 I’m currently learning Python for Data Analysis and Application Development<br>👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Data ANalytics Projects<br>🤔 I’m looking for help with Research work, tutoring and Data Ananlytics<br>💬 Ask me about Research, Data Science, Training and Teaching<br>📫 How to reach me: +2348132359210<br>My Website https://olufunmilola.innotechdev.com/<br>My Email address is Olufunmilolaolapejuolaewe@gmail.com<br>⚡ Fun fact: I have a Man-U fan just because my Husband is one 😄, He taught me all i know about football, I love fried meat 😆
