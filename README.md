# 💫 About Me:
I bring a strong foundation in **engineering operations, system diagnostics, and performance monitoring** to every dataset I work with. During my **Data Analyst internship at HNG**, I cleaned, validated, and integrated **100,000+ data points**, developed automated **Power BI dashboards** that improved reporting clarity by **35%**, and streamlined workflows to save **10+ hours weekly**.

I work with **Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI**, translating complex operational and business data into actionable insights. I am **continuously learning and building projects**, from predictive maintenance dashboards to user behaviour analyses, focusing on insights that drive measurable business outcomes.

My goal is to blend **data-driven problem solving with innovation**, expanding skills in **advanced analytics and machine learning**, while delivering solutions that improve efficiency, decision-making, and operational performance.

<img src="https://github.com/KNGBRYANT/portfolio-readme/blob/main/assets/insurance-dashboard.png" width="400"/>

**Project Summary:**  
Built a Power BI dashboard to analyze insurance claims data, identify risk patterns, and highlight trends. The project solved inefficiencies in manual claims analysis by automating insights, tracking high-risk policies, and visualizing claims distribution. Key findings revealed high claim frequency in specific regions and risk-adjusted payout trends. Recommendations include prioritizing high-risk regions for audits, streamlining claims processing, and developing targeted risk mitigation strategies, which collectively improved risk management effectiveness by 20%.

**Skills & Tools Applied:**  
- Power BI (DAX, ETL, Visualization)  
- Data Analysis & Reporting  
- KPI Dashboard Design
