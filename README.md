# 💫 About Me:
I bring a strong foundation in **engineering operations, system diagnostics, and performance monitoring** to every dataset I work with. During my **Data Analyst internship at HNG**, I cleaned, validated, and integrated **100,000+ data points**, developed automated **Power BI dashboards** that improved reporting clarity by **35%**, and streamlined workflows to save **10+ hours weekly**.

I work with **Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI**, translating complex operational and business data into actionable insights. I am **continuously learning and building projects**, from predictive maintenance dashboards to user behaviour analyses, focusing on insights that drive measurable business outcomes.

My goal is to blend **data-driven problem solving with innovation**, expanding skills in **advanced analytics and machine learning**, while delivering solutions that improve efficiency, decision-making, and operational performance.

**Project Summary:**  
Built a Power BI dashboard to analyze insurance claims data, identify risk patterns, and highlight trends. The project solved inefficiencies in manual claims analysis by automating insights, tracking high-risk policies, and visualizing claims distribution. Key findings revealed high claim frequency in specific regions and risk-adjusted payout trends. Recommendations include prioritizing high-risk regions for audits, streamlining claims processing, and developing targeted risk mitigation strategies, which collectively improved risk management effectiveness by 20%.

**Skills & Tools Applied:**  
- Power BI (DAX, ETL, Visualization)  
- Data Analysis & Reporting  
- KPI Dashboard Design

### SEO & Keyword Analytics in Nigerian Consumer Banking
<img src="[https://github.com/KNGBRYANT/KNGBRYANT/blob/main/Screenshot%202025-11-29%20003057.png](https://github.com/KNGBRYANT/KNGBRYANT/blob/main/Screenshot%202025-11-29%20022555.png)" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;">

**Project Summary:**  
Built a Power BI dashboard analyzing SEO visibility for Nigerian consumer banks, linking keyword performance to profitability. The project automated keyword extraction (85 banking keywords) via SerpApi, enriched with monthly search volumes, competition, and profit (PAT), and visualized insights. Key findings: UBA dominates with 32% visibility share; a weak positive correlation exists between SEO visibility and profit. Recommendations: invest in targeted content for high-PAT, low-SEO banks, optimize conversion for high-SEO, low-PAT banks, and monitor SERP ranks monthly to maximize ROI.

**Tools Applied:**  
- Power BI (visualization, dashboards, KPIs)  
- Google Apps Script (automation & API calls)  
- SerpApi (SEO data extraction)  
- Excel / Google Sheets (data cleaning, transformation, enrichment)  
- SQL (data manipulation & analysis)
