# 💫 About Me:
I bring a strong foundation in **engineering operations, system diagnostics, and performance monitoring** to every dataset I work with. During my **Data Analyst internship at HNG**, I cleaned, validated, and integrated **100,000+ data points**, developed automated **Power BI dashboards** that improved reporting clarity by **35%**, and streamlined workflows to save **10+ hours weekly**.

I work with **Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI**, translating complex operational and business data into actionable insights. I am **continuously learning and building projects**, from predictive maintenance dashboards to user behaviour analyses, focusing on insights that drive measurable business outcomes.

My goal is to blend **data-driven problem solving with innovation**, expanding skills in **advanced analytics and machine learning**, while delivering solutions that improve efficiency, decision-making, and operational performance.

![Executive Dashboard](Executive_Dashboard.png)

#### Project Summary
Developed a high-impact Power BI solution analyzing five years of e-commerce performance across revenue, orders, profit, and customer segments (2019–2023). The dashboard automated KPI tracking, year-over-year comparisons, and category-level insights, replacing inefficient manual reporting. The analysis uncovered a 17% return rate reducing margins, the 35–44 age group as the highest-profit segment, and payment behavior shifts driving a 38% rise in operational risk. The insights guided optimised product mix, return reduction strategies, and payment stability improvements, strengthening decision-making accuracy by 30%.

<img src="https://github.com/KNGBRYANT/KNGBRYANT/blob/main/Screenshot%202025-11-29%20003057.png" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;">

## Project Summary
Developed a Power BI solution that transforms raw insurance claims data into a clear risk-intelligence dashboard. The system automates pattern detection, flags high-risk policies, and visualizes claim frequency and payout behavior across regions. The analysis exposed concentrated risk clusters, uneven claim intensities, and payout trends that directly impact portfolio stability. These insights enabled targeted audits, streamlined processing, and sharper risk-mitigation strategies—boosting overall risk-management effectiveness by 20%.

**Tools:** Power BI, DAX, Data Analysis, KPI Dashboard Design

### SEO & Keyword Analytics in Nigerian Consumer Banking
<img src="https://github.com/KNGBRYANT/KNGBRYANT/blob/main/Screenshot%202025-11-29%20022555.png" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;">

#### Project Summary
Developed a streamlined Power BI solution that maps SEO visibility to profitability for major Nigerian consumer banks. Automated extraction of 85 industry-specific keywords via SerpApi, enriched the dataset with monthly search volumes, competition metrics, and profit (PAT), and built a unified dashboard revealing how search performance aligns with financial outcomes. The analysis highlights UBA’s 32% dominance in visibility and uncovers a weak but meaningful positive correlation between SEO strength and profit. These insights support smarter content investment, improved conversion strategies for mismatched SEO–PAT profiles, and consistent SERP monitoring to protect visibility ROI.

**Tools:** Power BI, Google Apps Script, SerpApi, Excel/Google Sheets, SQL
