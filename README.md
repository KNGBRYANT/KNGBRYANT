# 💫 About Me:
I bring a strong foundation in **engineering operations, system diagnostics, and performance monitoring** to every dataset I work with. During my **Data Analyst internship at HNG**, I cleaned, validated, and integrated **100,000+ data points**, developed automated **Power BI dashboards** that improved reporting clarity by **35%**, and streamlined workflows to save **10+ hours weekly**.

I work with **Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI**, translating complex operational and business data into actionable insights. I am **continuously learning and building projects**, from predictive maintenance dashboards to user behaviour analyses, focusing on insights that drive measurable business outcomes.

My goal is to blend **data-driven problem solving with innovation**, expanding skills in **advanced analytics and machine learning**, while delivering solutions that improve efficiency, decision-making, and operational performance.
